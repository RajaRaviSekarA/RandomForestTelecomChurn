## General Information
- Model the demand to manipulate the business strategy to understand the dynamics of a new market.
- The goal is to build a machine learning model that is able to predict churning customers based on the features provided for their usage.
Problem Statement
- The telecom industry faces high customer churn (15-25% annually) in a competitive market, making customer retention crucial due to the high cost of acquiring new customers.
- Telecom companies aim to predict and prevent churn of profitable customers using machine learning models based on customer usage data.
- The goal of the project is to build a machine learning model that can accurately predict which customers will churn.
